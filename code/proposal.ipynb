    "The estimation of parameters in mathematical models from observational data has led to the development of many different mathematical and computational advances. The Bayesian approach to the inversion problem allows us to take incorporate different kind of uncertainties in the estimation of these parameters, thus enlarging the space of well-posed problems to be solved. \n",

This example will help us analyse and compare different numerical solutions to the Bayesian formulation of its inversion problem."
