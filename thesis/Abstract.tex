\section*{Abstract}

The goal of this paper is to present a sound solution for solving inverse problems. We focus on the scenario where more data becomes available over time, called filtering problem, requiring to perform updates of existing parameter estimations. Formulated in the Bayesian framework, we prove that the inverse and filtering problems are well-posed under mild assumptions. We study the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to approximate the solution to Bayesian filtering problems and compare it to several related approximation algorithms. The use of the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is validated through proofs of convergence and numerical experiments. We also also illustrate the theoretical and numerical concepts presented in the paper by a concrete filtering problem, in which we attempt to estimate the parameter of a dynamical system from measurements of the system.
